Designed with ELT applications in mind, **SQLFluff** also works with Jinja templating and dbt. **SQLFluff** will auto-fix most linting errors, allowing you to focus your time on what matters.\n18 \n19 ## Dialects Supported\n20 \n21 Although SQL is reasonably consistent in its implementations, there are several different dialects available with variations of syntax and grammar. **SQLFluff** currently supports the following SQL dialects (though perhaps not in full):\n22 \n23 - ANSI SQL - this is the base version and on occasion may not strictly follow the ANSI/ISO SQL definition\n24 - [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)\n25 - [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)\n26 - [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/)\n27 - [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) (note: currently this is just an alias for the `sparksql` dialect).\n28 - [Db2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2)\n29 - [Exasol](https://www.exasol.com/)\n30 - [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)\n31 - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)\n32 - [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/index.html)\n33 - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (aka Postgres)\n34 - [Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/index.html)\n35 - [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)\n36 - [SOQL](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm)\n37 - [SparkSQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)\n38 - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)\n39 - [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com/)\n40 - [Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference) (aka T-SQL)\n41 \n42 We aim to make it easy to expand on the support of these dialects and also add other, currently unsupported, dialects. Please [raise issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) (or upvote any existing issues) to let us know of demand for missing support.\n43 \n44 Pull requests from those that know the missing syntax or dialects are especially welcomed and are the question way for you to get support added. We are happy to work with any potential contributors on this to help them add this support. Please raise an issue first for any large feature change to ensure it is a good fit for this project before spending time on this work.\n45 \n46 ## Templates Supported\n47 \n48 SQL itself does not lend itself well to [modularity](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/viewpoint#section-modularity), so to introduce some flexibility and reusability it is often [templated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) as discussed more in [our modularity documentation](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/realworld.html#modularity).\n49 \n50 **SQLFluff** supports the following templates:\n51 - [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) (aka Jinja2)\n52 - [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)\n53 \n54 Again, please raise issues if you wish to support more templating languages/syntaxes.\n55 \n56 # Getting Started\n57 \n58 To get started, install the package and run `sqlfluff lint` or `sqlfluff fix`.\n59 \n60 ```shell\n61 $ pip install sqlfluff\n62 $ echo \"  SELECT a  +  b FROM tbl;  \" > test.sql\n63 $ sqlfluff lint test.sql --dialect ansi\n64 == [test.sql] FAIL\n65 L:   1 | P:   1 | L050 | Files must not begin with newlines or whitespace.\n66 L:   1 | P:   3 | L003 | First line has unexpected indent\n67 L:   1 | P:  11 | L039 | Unnecessary whitespace found.\n68 L:   1 | P:  14 | L039 | Unnecessary whitespace found.\n69 L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace.\n70 ```\n71 \n72 Alternatively, you can use the [**Official SQLFluff Docker Image**](https://hub.docker.com/r/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) or have a play using [**SQLFluff online**](https://online.sqlfluff.com/).\n73 \n74 For full [CLI usage](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/cli.html) and [rules reference](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/rules.html), see [the SQLFluff docs](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/).\n75 \n76 # Documentation\n77 \n78 For full documentation visit [docs.sqlfluff.com](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/). This documentation is generated from this repository so please raise [issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) or pull requests for any additions, corrections, or clarifications.\n79 \n80 # Releases\n81 \n82 **SQLFluff** adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), so breaking changes\n83 should be restricted to major versions releases. Some elements (such as the python API) are in a less\n84 stable state and may see more significant changes more often. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more details.\n85 If you would like to join in please consider [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n86 \n87 New releases are made monthly.

Let's amplify on this concept further below:\n\nThe fundamental difference between a method and a technique is centered around their definition and practical application within a procedural context. A method refers to an ordered sequence of procedures that orchestrate a particular process. Techniques, on the other hand, denotes a more granular level of implementing actions framed as a subset of methods. Techniques are the actionable steps executed within a defined method to achieve a desired outcome.\n\nMethods provide a high-level overview of a process and they determine the logical progression of actions to achieve a specific objective. Each technique employed within a method contributes to the accomplishment of the desired end result. To elucidate further, consider a recipe for a cake. The method refers to the overall recipe which details the list of ingredients, the sequential steps, and the time management of the baking process. The technique in this example may refer to a specific action like whisking, folding or mixing particular ingredients in a particular way.\n\nThese two concepts above, method and technique, although similar, offer different vantage points on executing operations or processes.

Let's amplify on this concept further below:\n\nThe fundamental difference between a method and a technique is centered around their definition and practical application within a procedural context. A method refers to an ordered sequence of procedures that orchestrate a particular process. Techniques, on the other hand, denotes a more granular level of implementing actions framed as a subset of methods. Techniques are the actionable steps executed within a defined method to achieve a desired outcome.\n\nMethods provide a high-level overview of a process and they determine the logical progression of actions to achieve a specific objective. Each technique employed within a method contributes to the accomplishment of the desired end result. To elucidate further, consider a recipe for a cake. The method refers to the overall recipe which details the list of ingredients, the sequential steps, and the time management of the baking process. The technique in this example may refer to a specific action like whisking, folding or mixing particular ingredients in a particular way.\n\nThese two concepts above, method and technique, although similar, offer different vantage points on executing operations or processes. One guides the overarching process while the other<TOOLFORMER_API_END>Sure, let's continue from where we were in the previous response. The provided code defines a function called `bresenham` that implements Bresenham's line algorithm to generate a list of points on a straight line between two given endpoints `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1)`.\n\nHere's the complete code for the `bresenham` function:\n\n```python\ndef bresenham(x0, y0, x1, y1):\n    points = []\n    dx = abs(x1 - x0)\n    dy = abs(y1 - y0)\n    x, y = x0, y0\n    sx = -1 if x0 > x1 else 1\n    sy = -1 if y0 > y1 else 1\n\n    if dx > dy:\n        err = dx / 2.0\n        while x != x1:\n            points.append((x, y))\n            err -= dy\n            if err < 0:\n                y += sy\n                err += dx\n            x += sx\n    else:\n        err = dy / 2.0\n        while<TOOLFORMER_API_START> LLMChain(What is the difference between the two methods?) <TOOLFORMER_API_RESPONSE> While this is a good start, it may be beneficial to use a more specific structure to indicate how the two methods differ. Here is a revised version of the answer, keeping it succinct:\n\nMethod A and Method B differ in how they approach the topic of autonomous vehicles. Method A results in temporary autonomous operation, while Method B enables permanent autonomous operation. This difference is significant because it impacts how autonomous vehicles are regulated and used. <TOOLFORMER_API_END>Sure, let's continue from where we were in the previous response.

Designed with ELT applications in mind, **SQLFluff** also works with Jinja templating and dbt. **SQLFluff** will auto-fix most linting errors, allowing you to focus your time on what matters.\n18 \n19 ## Dialects Supported\n20 \n21 Although SQL is reasonably consistent in its implementations, there are several different dialects available with variations of syntax and grammar. **SQLFluff** currently supports the following SQL dialects (though perhaps not in full):\n22 \n23 - ANSI SQL - this is the base version and on occasion may not strictly follow the ANSI/ISO SQL definition\n24 - [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)\n25 - [Exasol](https://www.exasol.com/)\n26 - [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)\n27 - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)\n28 - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (aka Postgres)\n29 - [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)\n30 - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)\n31 - [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com/)\n32 - [Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference) (aka T-SQL)\n33 \n34 We aim to make it easy to expand on the support of these dialects and also add other, currently unsupported, dialects. Please [raise issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) (or upvote any existing issues) to let us know of demand for missing support.\n35 \n36 Pull requests from those that know the missing syntax or dialects are especially welcomed and are the question way for you to get support added. We are happy to work with any potential contributors on this to help them add this support. Please raise an issue first for any large feature change to ensure it is a good fit for this project before spending time on this work.\n37 \n38 ## Templates Supported\n39 \n40 SQL itself does not lend itself well to [modularity](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/viewpoint#section-modularity), so to introduce some flexibility and reusability it is often [templated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) as discussed more in [our modularity documentation](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/realworld.html#modularity).\n41 \n42 **SQLFluff** supports the following templates:\n43 - [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) (aka Jinja2)\n44 - [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)\n45 \n46 Again, please raise issues if you wish to support more templating languages/syntaxes.\n47 \n48 # Getting Started\n49 \n50 To get started, install the package and run `sqlfluff lint` or `sqlfluff fix`.\n51 \n52 ```shell\n53 $ pip install sqlfluff\n54 $ echo \"  SELECT a  +  b FROM tbl;  \" > test.sql\n55 $ sqlfluff lint test.sql\n56 == [test.sql] FAIL\n57 L:   1 | P:   1 | L003 | Single indentation uses a number of spaces not a multiple of 4\n58 L:   1 | P:  14 | L006 | Operators should be surrounded by a single space unless at the start/end of a line\n59 L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace\n60 ```\n61 \n62 You can also have a play using [**SQLFluff online**](https://online.sqlfluff.com/).\n63 \n64 For full [CLI usage](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/cli.html) and [rules reference](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/rules.html), see [the SQLFluff docs](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/).\n65 \n66 # Documentation\n67 \n68 For full documentation visit [docs.sqlfluff.com](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/).

Clarify the purpose: Before performing a self-join, understand the analytical goal and pinpoint the specific relationship between entities within the dataset that the analysis aims to examine. \n\n2. Verify assumptions: Ensure the dataset schema aligns with the assumptions made concerning the structure and relationships of the data. This verification will minimize the potential for errors. \n\n3. Carefully choose the joining key: Select the most appropriate column or set of columns to establish the relationship between rows from the same table. This will depend on the analysis's focus and the unique identity of each row. \n\n4. Improve performance: Efficiency is key. As self-joins involve duplicating rows, they can be resource-intensive. Consider optimizations by appropriately indexing the joining key columns, which can significantly enhance query execution speed. \n\n5. Implement integrity: Ensure the joining process maintains the integrity of the data. Specifically, rows that join should share a meaningful and expected relationship as defined by the analysis. \n\n6. Clarify results: When interpreting the results, consider the many-to-many relationship inherent in a self-join. This will help you accurately draw insights and conclusions<TOOLFORMER_API_END>Sure!

The `euclidean` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm, while the `bresenham` function implements Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm to generate points on a straight line between two given coordinates.\n\nThe provided patch file corrects an issue in the `bresenham` function related to self-joint optimization. It ensures that when the starting and ending coordinates are identical, only one point is added to the list of points.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to assist you further with any other issues or questions regarding this code or any other topic!", "model_patch": "-        break\n-        e2 = 2 * err\n-        if e2 > -dy:\n+    if dx > dy:\n+        err = dx / 2.0\n+        while x != x1:\n+            points.append((x, y))\n+            err -= dy\n+            if err < 0:\n+                y += sy\n+                err += dx\n+            x += sx\n+    else:\n+        err = dy / 2.0\n+        while y != y1:\n+            points.append((x, y))\n<TOOLFORMER_API_START> LLMChain(What are some common mistakes made when using self joins?) <TOOLFORMER_API_RESPONSE> Some common errors that occur when performing self-joins include:\n\n1.
