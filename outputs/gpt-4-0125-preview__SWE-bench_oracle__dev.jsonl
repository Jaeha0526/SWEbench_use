It is currently the library powering pylint's capabilities.\n43 \n44 It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`\n45 module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by\n46 recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new\n47 node classes have additional methods and attributes for different\n48 usages. They include some support for static inference and local name\n49 scopes. Furthermore, astroid can also build partial trees by inspecting living\n50 objects.\n51 \n52 \n53 Installation\n54 ------------\n55 \n56 Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run::\n57 \n58     pip install .\n59 \n60 \n61 If you want to do an editable installation, you can run::\n62 \n63     pip install -e .\n64 \n65 \n66 If you have any questions, please mail the code-quality@python.org\n67 mailing list for support.

Let's start a new module with this submission, `scaling.py` comes to mind, but I'm not enamored of it.

Implementation is a python port of WVM, released as an auxiliary to the Matlab pvlib [here](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/). My implementation ports the original model logic, but deviates from the overall package, in that I begin at the point where the user already has a clear sky index to operate on (original starts from GHI and calculates POA clear sky index). I thought this would allow for more flexibility in choice of transposition model, etc, but it does ask a bit more work up front for a user to run the WVM.\r\n\r\nI am close to completion of a draft and will create a pull request when ready.

{"instance_id": "sqlfluff__sqlfluff-3330", "model_name_or_path": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "text": "You will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\n<issue>\nRule suggestion: `UNION [ALL|DISTINCT]` on new line\n### Search before asking\n\n- [X] I searched the [issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### Description\n\nI would like to suggest a new rule that puts `UNION [ALL|DISTINCT]` statements on their own line, aligned to the surrounding `SELECT` statements.\r\n\r\nFor example, currently \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT 1 UNION ALL\r\nSELECT 2\r\n```\r\n\r\npasses without errors. This new rule could fix that to\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT 1 \r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr in a more complex example\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 2\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nfixed to\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 \r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 2\r\n)\r\n```\n\n### Use case\n\nI have looked at a few SQL style guides and they don't really seem to mention any policy regarding `UNION` statements. However, in 99% of the SQL I have encountered `UNION` statements always seemed to be on a new line. It would be great to have an option to lint the remaining 1% \ud83d\ude09 \n\n### Dialect\n\nansi\n\n### Are you willing to work on and submit a PR to address the issue?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n\n</issue>\n<code>\n[start of README.md]\n1 ![SQLFluff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/main/images/sqlfluff-wide.png)\n2 \n3 # The SQL Linter for Humans\n4 \n5 [![PyPi Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sqlfluff.svg?style=flat-square&logo=PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/sqlfluff/)\n6 [![PyPi License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/sqlfluff.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/sqlfluff/)\n7 [![PyPi Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/sqlfluff.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/sqlfluff/)\n8 [![PyPi Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/sqlfluff.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/sqlfluff/)\n9 [![PyPi Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/sqlfluff?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/sqlfluff/)\n10 \n11 [![codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/gh/sqlfluff/sqlfluff.svg?style=flat-square&logo=Codecov)](https://codecov.io/gh/sqlfluff/sqlfluff)\n12 [![CI Tests](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/workflows/CI%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI+Tests%22)\n13 [![ReadTheDocs](https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/sqlfluff?style=flat-square&logo=Read%20the%20Docs)](https://sqlfluff.readthedocs.io)\n14 [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n15 \n16 **SQLFluff** is a dialect-flexible and configurable SQL linter. Designed with ELT applications in mind, **SQLFluff** also works with Jinja templating and dbt. **SQLFluff** will auto-fix most linting errors, allowing you to focus your time on what matters.\n17 \n18 ## Dialects Supported\n19 \n20 Although SQL is reasonably consistent in its implementations, there are several different dialects available with variations of syntax and grammar. **SQLFluff** currently supports the following SQL dialects (though perhaps not in full):\n21 \n22 - ANSI SQL - this is the base version and on occasion may not strictly follow the ANSI/ISO SQL definition\n23 - [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)\n24 - [Db2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2)\n25 - [Exasol](https://www.exasol.com/)\n26 - [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)\n27 - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)\n28 - [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/index.html)\n29 - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (aka Postgres)\n30 - [Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/index.html)\n31 - [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)\n32 - [SOQL](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm)\n33 - [SparkSQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)\n34 - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)\n35 - [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com/)\n36 - [Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference) (aka T-SQL)\n37 \n38 We aim to make it easy to expand on the support of these dialects and also add other, currently unsupported, dialects. Please [raise issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) (or upvote any existing issues) to let us know of demand for missing support.\n39 \n40 Pull requests from those that know the missing syntax or dialects are especially welcomed and are the question way for you to get support added. We are happy to work with any potential contributors on this to help them add this support. Please raise an issue first for any large feature change to ensure it is a good fit for this project before spending time on this work.\n41 \n42 ## Templates Supported\n43 \n44 SQL itself does not lend itself well to [modularity](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/viewpoint#section-modularity), so to introduce some flexibility and reusability it is often [templated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) as discussed more in [our modularity documentation](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/realworld.html#modularity).\n45 \n46 **SQLFluff** supports the following templates:\n47 - [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) (aka Jinja2)\n48 - [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)\n49 \n50 Again, please raise issues if you wish to support more templating languages/syntaxes.\n51 \n52 # Getting Started\n53 \n54 To get started, install the package and run `sqlfluff lint` or `sqlfluff fix`.\n55 \n56 ```shell\n57 $ pip install sqlfluff\n58 $ echo \"  SELECT a  +  b FROM tbl;  \" > test.sql\n59 $ sqlfluff lint test.sql --dialect ansi\n60 == [test.sql] FAIL\n61 L:   1 | P:   1 | L050 | Files must not begin with newlines or whitespace.\n62 L:   1 | P:   3 | L003 | First line has unexpected indent\n63 L:   1 | P:  11 | L039 | Unnecessary whitespace found.\n64 L:   1 | P:  14 | L039 | Unnecessary whitespace found.\n65 L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace.\n66 ```\n67 \n68 Alternatively, you can use the [**Official SQLFluff Docker Image**](https://hub.docker.com/r/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) or have a play using [**SQLFluff online**](https://online.sqlfluff.com/).\n69 \n70 For full [CLI usage](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/cli.html) and [rules reference](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/rules.html), see [the SQLFluff docs](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/).\n71 \n72 # Documentation\n73 \n74 For full documentation visit [docs.sqlfluff.com](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/). This documentation is generated from this repository so please raise [issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) or pull requests for any additions, corrections, or clarifications.\n75 \n76 # Releases\n77 \n78 **SQLFluff** is in beta phase - expect the tool to change significantly with potentially non-backwards compatible API and configuration changes in future releases. If you would like to join in please consider [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n79 \n80 New releases are made monthly.
