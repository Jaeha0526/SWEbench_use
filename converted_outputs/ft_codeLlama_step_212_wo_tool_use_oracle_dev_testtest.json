    "model_patch": "<TOOLFORMER_API_START> LLMChain(What is the issue with the --disable_progress_bar flag?) <TOOLFORMER_API_RESPONSE> The issue with the --disable_progress_bar flag is that it is not functioning as intended. When this flag is used, it should disable the progress bar that is typically displayed during the execution of a command or task. However, in the case of the provided code, it appears that the flag is not being recognized or handled properly, resulting in an error message indicating that the option is unknown.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the code needs to be modified to ensure that the --disable_progress_bar flag is correctly recognized and handled. This may involve updating the code to properly parse and process the command-line options, as well as ensuring that the flag is appropriately accounted for in the code logic. \n\nOnce these changes are made, the --disable_progress_bar flag should function as intended, allowing users to disable the progress bar during the execution of a command or task. <TOOLFORMER_API_END>--- a/src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py\n+++ b/src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py\n@@ -1,27 +1,35 @@\n def euclidean(a, b):\n-    while b:\n-        a, b = b, a % b\n-    return a\n+    if b == 0:\n+        return a\n+    return euclidean(b, a % b)\n \n \n def bresenham(x0, y0, x1, y1):\n     points = []\n     dx = abs(x1 - x0)\n     dy = abs(y1 - y0)\n-    sx = 1 if x0 < x1 else -1\n-    sy = 1 if y0 < y1 else -1\n-    err = dx - dy\n+    x, y = x0, y0\n+    sx = -1 if x0 > x1 else 1\n+    sy = -1 if y0 > y1 else 1\n \n-    while True:\n-        points.append((x0, y0))\n-        if x0 == x1 and y0 == y1:\n-            break\n-        e2 = 2 * err\n-        if e2 > -dy:\n+    if dx > dy:\n+        err = dx / 2.0\n+        while x != x1:\n+            points.append((x, y))\n             err -= dy\n-            x0 += sx\n-        if e2 < dx:\n-            err += dx\n-            y0 += sy\n+            if err < 0:\n+                y += sy\n+                err += dx\n+            x += sx\n+    else:\n+        err = dy / 2.0\n+        while y != y1:\n+            points.append((x, y))\n+            err -= dx\n+            if err < 0:\n+                x += sx\n+                err += dy\n+            y += sy\n \n+    points.append((x, y))\n     return points\n</patch>",
