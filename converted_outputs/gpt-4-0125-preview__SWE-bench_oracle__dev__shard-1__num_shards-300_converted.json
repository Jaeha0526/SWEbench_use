More information on\n+Sandia Labs PV performance modeling programs can be found at\n+https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/. We collaborate with the PVLIB MATLAB project,\n+but operate independently of it.\n+\n+\n+Documentation\n+=============\n+\n+Full documentation can be found at [readthedocs](http://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n+\n+\n+Installation\n+============\n+\n+pvlib-python releases may be installed using the ``pip`` and ``conda`` tools.\n+Please see the [Installation page](http://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) of the documentation for complete instructions.\n+\n+pvlib-python is compatible with Python 3.5 and above.\n+\n+**Python 2.7 support ended on June 1, 2019, with pvlib-python 0.6.3.**\n+\n+\n+Contributing\n+============\n+\n+We need your help to make pvlib-python a great tool!\n+Please see the [Contributing page](http://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html) for more on how you can contribute.\n+The long-term success of pvlib-python requires substantial community support.\n+\n+\n+License\n+=======\n+\n+BSD 3-clause\n+\n+\n+Getting support\n+===============\n+\n+pvlib usage questions can be asked on\n+[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and tagged with\n+the [pvlib](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pvlib) tag.\n+\n+The [pvlib-python google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pvlib-python)\n+is used for discussing various topics of interest to the pvlib-python\n+community. We also make new version announcements on the google group.\n+\n+If you suspect that you may have discovered a bug or if you'd like to\n+change something about pvlib, then please make an issue on our\n+[GitHub issues page](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues).\n+\n+\n+Citing\n+======\n+\n+If you use pvlib-python in a published work, please cite:\n+\n+  William F.
